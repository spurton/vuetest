# Task
We have a news reader app sourcing data from the NY Times. The problem is that currently we're only rendering the raw JSON. Please create a UI using Vue and JavaScript.

## Base requirement
Your UI should render a list of top news stories. It would be nice if they were divided into sections. Examining the data currently being returned should give you a good idea of what those sections are. There's no need to use all the data. Please don't, actually.

## What we're looking for
Excellent JavaScript and Vue skills

## It'd be awesome if you included ...
Tests! Unit and/or E2E. 

## Time limit?
Nah, but try to keep it under 4 hours. We're looking for quality, not quantity. We don't care about styling, so focus on making good engineering decisions

#### Reach out if you have questions, and good luck!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
